# Artist-Average-word-counter
This program allows the user to enter the name of an artist or a band and the program will return the average amount words their songs have.

NOTE:

This program can often take a long time to respond and may say not responding this is becuase of the 'https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#' api having very slow response times for requests.

The requests and musicbrainzngs libraries need to be installed.

Only the pyton file needed.
